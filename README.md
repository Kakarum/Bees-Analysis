### Goal:
Every day, we are reminded of the crucial role that bees play in sustaining life on Earth.
But, bee populations face increasing threats from a variety of environmental and anthropogenic factors, such as climate change, pesticide exposure, habitat loss, and diseases.

Our aim is to explore and quantify the influence of atmospheric and pollution variables on bee productivity.
